https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/life-series-industrialized

## Introduction
Do you think normal Lifesteal is boring? Trying something new? Or wanting PvP friends to try modded? Well this is the Perfect pack. Life Series: Industrialized focuses on creating a new PvP style while giving you the option to progress in the modded world's most classic tech mods.
## What is Life Series?
Life Series is a type of plugin or mod that changes anything related to your health. It can be by changing your max health or only allowing a set number of deaths etc. Industrialized focuses on the variant named Lifesteal. In Lifesteal you gain a heart whenever you kill somebody and lose a heart whenever you die. This makes the game have a natural end whenever most players have lost all their hearts.
## About
Life Series: Industrialized is a modpack focusing on Lifesteal with many PvP and Tech mods to make the Journey more interesting. The pack is designed to always have something to do without becoming Overpowered. In a normal playthrough with your friends you'll not reach the end before the game ends. In Life Series: Industrialized contain:
* New and customizable tools and weapons.
* New enchants.
* New Combat Methods.
* Better Terrain Generation.
* Unique mod specialisations
* Progression Guide.
## For server admins
These are some recommended rules. It's not always possible to follow these rules as a community since every community is unique. These rules create an environment where anything can happen!

Beware that these rules can create in real life dramas!
1. Everyone can kill absolutely anyone.
2. Everyone can break their promises.
3. Everyone can steal from anyone.
4. No destruction of other peoples bases. (Questionable)

The mod FTBteams exist. I cannot remove this mod but please make sure that this mod isn't used. The mod disables friendly fire, which is bad if someone switches alliances or spies on another team.

The server file (will later) contain a small guide on how to set up your server with all configuration settings.
